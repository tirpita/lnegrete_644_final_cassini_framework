cassini framework bugs
----------------------
CSS COMPONENT MISSING <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/slider.css">
the css testimonial slider component is missing.  i searched all of the css files for the id and tags outlined in the documentation, but it's nowhere to be found...

UPDATE - CSS slider added to cassini site- was able to download and use.
------------------------
CSS - had to fix a lot of errors in the @media query section:
didn't use lintor?  Lots of extra parenthasis had to be removed and extra # in front of name colors. example #red
